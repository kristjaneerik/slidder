slid[i]der [the i is silent] aka slide image updater

Does this ever happen to you?

You are working on a presentation with 50 slides and 75 plots that you've generated,
but now the boss wants to change all the colors to purple.

With slidder you can easily update all the figures in your presentation with the push of a button!

slidder takes a Slides presentation and a directory, and updates matching plots.

Matching is done based on writing the filename in the "alt text" of the image object.

# TODOs

- [ ] re-set the alt text / description
- [ ] proper installation


# Privacy policy

slidder needs read-write access to your Google Slides in order to do its job.
It also needs read-write access your Drive to find Slides presentations by name and to upload
your plots temporarily.

These data are only used during the duration of the command execution and are not abused.
